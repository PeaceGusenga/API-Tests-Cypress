> Test Objective:
The objective of these tests is to verify the functionality and behavior of the API endpoints for the SmartPhone application.

> Test Scope:
The scope of these tests includes the following API endpoints:
/AddProcessors
/GetAllBrands
/GetAllProcessors
/GetAllSmartPhones

> Test Approach:
The tests will be implemented using Cypress, a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework. The tests will focus on validating the following aspects:
Correctness of API responses (status codes, response bodies)
Validation of response structure and data integrity
Verification of error handling and error messages
Performance and reliability of API calls

> Test Environment:
Operating System: [Specify the OS where the tests will be executed]
Test Environment URL: https://localhost:5002
Test Data: Test data will be provided through test scenarios and test data files.

> Test Scenarios:
The test scenarios will cover the following aspects for each API endpoint:
Positive test cases to validate successful operations
Negative test cases to validate error handling and edge cases
Data validation to ensure the correctness of response structures and data integrity
Performance testing to measure the response time and handle high load scenarios

> Test Execution:
The tests will be executed as part of the continuous integration process or on-demand basis. The test execution process includes the following steps:
Setup the test environment with the required dependencies
Execute the Cypress API tests using the Cypress test runner
Capture test results and generate reports
Analyze test results and identify any failures or issues

> Test Reporting:
Test results will be recorded and reported using the following mechanisms:
Cypress test runner console output
Test reports generated by Cypress (if configured)
Failure reports and logs for further analysis

> Test Dependencies:
The test environment should be accessible and running during test execution.
Test data should be available and properly configured for each test scenario.
Any required test fixtures or test setup should be completed before test execution.

> Test Risks and Mitigation:
SSL certificate issues: The test environment may require handling SSL certificate validation. Appropriate configurations and trust stores should be set up to handle SSL certificate errors.
Test data dependencies: Test scenarios may require specific test data or data states. Adequate test data preparation and setup should be performed to ensure test data availability.

> Test Schedule:
Define the test execution schedule based on project timelines and priorities.
Include time for test setup, test execution, result analysis, and any necessary retesting.

> Test Deliverables:
Test strategy document
Test scripts and code files
Test reports and logs
